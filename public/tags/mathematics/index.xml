      <description>Take a look at the following sequence of numbers:
\[0, 1, 3, 6, 2, 7, 13, 20, 12, 21, 11, 22, \ldots\]
If you have not seen it before, you probably will not be able to figure out the pattern in this sequence. It is the so called Recamán’s sequence, attributed to the Colombian mathematician Bernardo Recamán.
Despite its apparent complexity, the rules that generate this sequence are quite simple. The best way to understand the generating algorithm is to draw the number line from 0 to, say, 7 to start:</description>

      <description>I was reading about the Hidden beauty of multiplication tables and I thought it could be fun to make some of the cool plots in that article with R.
As I was trying to visualize new patterns in the multiplication table, I ended up with some useful fuctions that I decided to put in a simple R package called multable that you can install from GitHub.
The multiplication table Consider the standard \(10 \times 10\) multiplication table, with the first row and the first column taking the values \(1\) through \(10\), forming a grid with the corresponding products.</description>
