[{"authors":null,"categories":["English"],"content":"Kirk Goldsberry is one of the most popular figures in the basketball analytics world. He is known mainly for the use of shot charts in his analyses. Here there is an example with all the shots Lebron James has taken in his career:\nHappy Birthday, LeBron His constellation so far... pic.twitter.com/4HuCjTgl4x\n\u0026mdash; Kirk Goldsberry (@kirkgoldsberry) December 30, 2018  Shot charts can be useful for, say, identifying tenedencies on offense of a given player/team, showing what spots on the court a player is most effective at, or analyzing what type of shots a team allows its opponents.\nThe league that I play in, called LEB Oro, provides shot charts in its platform, Baloncesto en Vivo. For this blog post, I created an R package called rfeb, that allows us to easily scrape the shot coordinates provided by this website and plot the shot charts of the game or games we want.\nHaving said that, for some strange reason, the platform Baloncesto en Vivo does not provide any type of selection menu to access games played weeks before (or seasons before). Only the most recent games are visible.\nIt is possible to access previous games if you know the game id and adding it to the base url (http://baloncestoenvivo.feb.es/Game/). However, it appears as if the data gets erased as time goes by. At the moment of writting this post, only the games played before week 13 of this season are available.\nMoreover, the data themselves are a bit shaky. As I have come to find out, several gyms in the league produce shot charts that are obviously wrong.\nHuesca and Real Canoe are the main suspects. I found several cases but take a look at this game between ZTE Real Canoe and Cerramimbre Valladolid played at the gym of the former. According to the provided shot chart neither one of the two teams shot one shot inside the paint… Until these flagrant errors are eliminated, any analysis done with these data must be taken with a grain of salt.\nShot charts rfeb is an R package that I created to work with the data available in Baloncesto en Vivo. rfeb contains two main functions at the moment:\n extract_shots(): Scrapes the shot data of the specified game ids\n plot_shotchart(): Plots shot charts with these data\n  The rfeb package can be installed as follows:\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;) devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;solmos/rfeb\u0026quot;) You can check out the code of these functions in its Github repository. Note that even though I am going to extract data from my league (LEB Oro), it can also be used to work with the other leagues organized by the Spanish basketball federation (FEB).\nSo I am going to use rfeb to show how to plot shot charts with the data from the games played throughout the weekend of 01/11/2019.\nThe ids of these games go from 2010208 to 2010216. I use extract_shots() to scrape the shot data for these 9 games. We get a data frame where each row represents a shot taken, for which the following variables were recorded:\n t = Time elapsed since the start of the game\n x, y = Shot coordinates\n team = The team for which the player taking the shot plays\n player = Jersey number of the player that took the shot\n quarter = Quarter in which the shot was taken\n game = Game id\n made = Shot missed (0) or made (1)\n  library(rfeb) game_ids \u0026lt;- 2010208:2010216 shots \u0026lt;- extract_shots(game_ids) head(shots) ## t x y team player quarter game made ## 1 00:39 715.20 833.85 SÁENZ HORECA ARABERRI 3 1 2010208 Missed ## 2 00:47 824.20 245.25 LEYMA CORUÑA 22 1 2010208 Made ## 3 01:23 1069.45 485.05 LEYMA CORUÑA 4 1 2010208 Missed ## 4 01:35 628.00 523.20 SÁENZ HORECA ARABERRI 10 1 2010208 Missed ## 5 01:43 72.10 283.40 SÁENZ HORECA ARABERRI 3 1 2010208 Missed ## 6 01:48 687.95 207.10 LEYMA CORUÑA 1 1 2010208 Made Once we have the data, we can use plot_shotcharts(). This function uses ggplot2 to plot the shot chart and it is possible to specify the mapping arguments that we want for the geom_point() geom. For instance, we can color the points according to whether the shot was missed or made.\nBelow I show all the shots taken in these 9 games in one chart:\nplot_shotchart(shots, color = made) You probably do not want to show all the shots in one chart. It is possible to use other ggplot2 functions to adapt the plot to our needs. We can use, for instance, facet_wrap() to obtain a matrix of shotcharts with the different games:\nlibrary(ggplot2) plot_shotchart(shots, color = made) + facet_wrap(~ game) Lastly, I use dplyr to filter the shots that we want to show. Let’s say I want to see the shots I took in the game against Palencia played during the chosen week. The id for this game is 2010215 and I wear number 41:\nlibrary(dplyr) shots %\u0026gt;% filter(game == 2010215 \u0026amp; player == \u0026quot;41\u0026quot;) %\u0026gt;% plot_shotchart(color = made) + ggtitle(\u0026quot;Sergio Olmos vs. Palencia\u0026quot;) rfeb is still in development. My plan is to add more functionality to it so that not only shot data can be analyzed but regular stats or play-by-play data can be used as well. I will write more posts as I add more functions to the package.\n Resources  Web Scraping 201: finding the API\n Getting started with httr\n Drawing a basketball court with R\n   ","date":1548288000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548288000,"objectID":"c46e871b11ae3701f9b852dfeee72d38","permalink":"/post/2019-01-24-graficos-de-tiro-con-r/shotcharts-with-r/","publishdate":"2019-01-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2019-01-24-graficos-de-tiro-con-r/shotcharts-with-r/","section":"post","summary":"How to plot shot charts for games in LEB Oro using the rfeb package","tags":["R","Basketball"],"title":"rfeb: Shot charts with R","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["English"],"content":"I was reading about the Hidden beauty of multiplication tables and I thought it could be fun to make some of the cool plots in that article with R.\nAs I was trying to visualize new patterns in the multiplication table, I ended up with some useful fuctions that I decided to put in a simple R package called multable that you can install from GitHub.\nThe multiplication table Consider the standard \\(10 \\times 10\\) multiplication table, with the first row and the first column taking the values \\(1\\) through \\(10\\), forming a grid with the corresponding products.\nlibrary(tidyverse) # Data frame with all the values of the 10x10 multiplication table multiplication_table \u0026lt;- tibble( x = 1:10, y = 1:10 ) %\u0026gt;% # Get all combination of x and y complete(x, y) %\u0026gt;% # Get the product of all combinations mutate(product = x * y) ggplot(multiplication_table, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = product), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + # We want the table to start with 1 in the upper-left corner scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + # We want to always display the tables as squares coord_fixed() + theme_void() For purposes that we will see next, I am going to add a row and a column of zeros above and to the left of our table, respectively:\nmultiplication_table \u0026lt;- tibble( x = 0:10, y = 0:10 ) %\u0026gt;% complete(x, y) %\u0026gt;% mutate(product = x * y) ggplot(multiplication_table, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = product), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + theme_void() Next, we will discover some beautiful symmetries by coloring the rectangles of the multiplication table that correspond to multiples of a number \\(k\\) for various values of \\(k\\).\n Single multiples We say that \\(c\\) is a multiple of \\(k\\) if \\(c = n k\\) for some integer \\(n\\), which is called the multiplier. So we can tell if a given number \\(c\\) is a multiple of \\(k\\) if the division \\(c\\) over \\(k\\) has remainder 0.\nLet’s begin with \\(k = 2\\). I am going to color the cells corresponding to multiples of \\(2\\) in one color and non-multiples of \\(2\\) in another color. Check out the pattern it emerges:\nlibrary(wesanderson) m2 \u0026lt;- multiplication_table %\u0026gt;% mutate(multiple_of_2 = product %% 2 == 0) # Color palette chosen from the wesanderson package colors \u0026lt;- wes_palette(name = \u0026quot;Zissou1\u0026quot;, n = 2) ggplot(m2, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = multiple_of_2), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = product), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + scale_fill_manual(values = colors, name = \u0026quot;Multiple of 2?\u0026quot;, labels = c(\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Yes\u0026quot;)) + theme_void() If we look closely we can see that the whole pattern above can be pieced together using the following fundamental block:\nblock_2 \u0026lt;- tibble( x = c(0,1), y = c(0,1) ) %\u0026gt;% complete(x, y) %\u0026gt;% distinct() %\u0026gt;% mutate(product = x * y, multiple = product %% 2 == 0) ggplot(block_2, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = multiple), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_manual(values = colors, guide = FALSE) + theme_void() As Zoheir Barka explains in his article mentioned at the beginning, the fundamental building block contains \\(k \\times k = 2 \\times 2 = 4\\) cells of the multiplication table. The fact that, in the case of a single multiple, each side of the fundamental building block is \\(k\\) can be useful when plotting our tables.\nWe want to explore the patterns for different values of \\(k\\) so I created a simple function that plots a colored multiplication table for the supplied \\(k\\) and the supplied dimensions. Multiples and non-multiples are colored the same way as before so I chose to drop the legend for aesthetic reasons.\n# Auxiliary function to create a data frame # with the values of the multiplication table create_mtable \u0026lt;- function(xmax, ymax) { data.frame( x = 0:xmax, y = 0:ymax ) %\u0026gt;% complete(x, y) %\u0026gt;% mutate(product = x * y) } # Plot the colored table draw_pattern \u0026lt;- function(k, xmax, ymax) { # Colors chosen from the Zissou1 palette in the wesanderson package colors \u0026lt;- wesanderson::wes_palette(name = \u0026quot;Zissou1\u0026quot;, n = 2) tab \u0026lt;- create_mtable(xmax, ymax) %\u0026gt;% mutate(multiple = product %% k == 0) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = multiple), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = product), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + scale_fill_manual(values = colors) + theme_void() + guides(fill = FALSE) tab } We can now easily plot the colored tables for different values of \\(k\\) and see what patterns emerge:\ndraw_pattern(k = 4, xmax = 4 * 3, ymax = 4 * 3) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Multiples of 4\u0026quot;) draw_pattern(6, 6 * 2, 6 * 2) + labs(title = \u0026quot;Multiples of 6\u0026quot;) Notice that we set the “length” of each side of the tables to multiples of \\(k\\) so that the pattern is symmetric.\n Multiple multiples We can plot more interesting (and beautiful) patterns if we use multiple multiples, and corresponding to them, multiple colors.\nConsider the multiples of \\(k_1 = 2\\) and \\(k_2 = 3\\). I will color each square of the multiplication table according to the following criteria:\n Not multiple of neither 2 nor 3\n Multiple only of 2\n Multiple only of 3\n Multiple of both 2 and 3\n  multiple_multiples \u0026lt;- tibble( x = 0:12, y = 0:12 ) %\u0026gt;% complete(x, y) %\u0026gt;% mutate(product = x * y, m2 = product %% 2 == 0, m3 = product %% 3 == 0, inter = interaction(m2, m3)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(interaction = recode_factor(inter, FALSE.FALSE = \u0026quot;Multple of neither\u0026quot;, TRUE.FALSE = \u0026quot;Multiple of 2\u0026quot;, FALSE.TRUE = \u0026quot;Multiple of 3\u0026quot;, TRUE.TRUE = \u0026quot;Multiple of both\u0026quot;)) ggplot(multiple_multiples, aes(x, y)) + geom_tile(aes(fill = interaction), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + geom_text(aes(label = product), color = \u0026quot;white\u0026quot;) + scale_fill_brewer(palette = \u0026quot;Pastel1\u0026quot;, name = element_blank()) + scale_y_continuous(trans = \u0026quot;reverse\u0026quot;) + coord_fixed() + theme_void() Notice that I used a \\(12 \\times 12\\) table so that I got a symmetric pattern. I did this because I knew that the fundamental building block is given by the least common multiple of \\(2\\) and \\(3\\). That is, in this case the fundamental block consists of \\(6 \\times 6 = 36\\) little cells.\n multable package I have created a simple R package out of this idea of coloring the factors of different numbers, called multable. You can install it with\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;devtools\u0026quot;) devtools::install_github(\u0026quot;solmos/multable\u0026quot;) As of now, the package contains just two functions:\n create_table() generates a data frame with the grid values and identifies the factors for different values of k\n draw_pattern() plots the multiplication table coloring the different cells according to what value of k a given cell is a factor of\n  Check out the code for these functions here. My plan is to add more functionality to this package but you can actually do some pretty cool visualizations as it is.\n  ","date":1541462400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541462400,"objectID":"07751ebac12398d79e1288c868fb2268","permalink":"/post/2018-11-06-multiplication-table/multiplication-table-with-r/","publishdate":"2018-11-06T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2018-11-06-multiplication-table/multiplication-table-with-r/","section":"post","summary":"I show how to visualize the patterns that emerge in the multiplication table and present an R package I created for this purpose","tags":["R","Mathematics"],"title":"Exploring the multiplication table with R","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;\n","date":1536444000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536444000,"objectID":"6a451186c775f5f0adb3a0416d0cb711","permalink":"/tutorial/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/tutorial/example/","section":"tutorial","summary":"In this tutorial, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my top 10 tips for getting started with Academic:\nTip 1 \u0026hellip;\nTip 2 \u0026hellip;","tags":null,"title":"Example Page","type":"docs"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
