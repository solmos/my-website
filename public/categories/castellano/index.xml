      <description>The other day I started building a win probability model for the Euroleague but soon I stumped into a little problem. This kind of model uses a set of covariates to predict a teamâ€™s probability of winning as the game progresses. One of these covariates is usually some kind of indicator of how good or bad a given team is before starting the game. Many of these models use betting spreads from betting companies as the indicator.</description>
