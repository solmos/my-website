# About

I am a statistician focusing on research questions related to the urban environment and health. Before joining ISGlobal, I was a [professional basketball player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fS4MCVzFu4) for 10+ years. I am also a data science consultant for [ALBA Berlin](https://www.albaberlin.de/) working on sport science and basketball analytics. In my spare time, I am developing several open-source R packages for obtaining and analyzing basketball generated data.

In my blog, I mainly write about using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to analyze and visualize different kinds of data. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish.
