# About

[Professional basketball player](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fS4MCVzFu4) for 10+ years interested in the analytic side of the game. Currently developing several R packages and Shiny apps for analyzing basketball data generated by different leagues in Europe.

In my blog, I mainly write about using the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) to analyze and visualize different kinds of data. Sometimes in English, sometimes in Spanish.
