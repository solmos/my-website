# About

After graduating with a Mathematics degree in 2009 I started playing basketball professionally and that has been [my job](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1fS4MCVzFu4) since then. I am also a research collaborator at [Biostatech](http://biostatech.com/), a statistical consulting company based in Santiago de Compostela.

As a consultant, I have used statistical and machine learning methods in various fields such as ecology, genomics and pharmacology. Recently, I have been playing with some sports data as well.
